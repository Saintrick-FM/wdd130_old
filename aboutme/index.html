        <p>
            I am a junior fullstack developper with 2 years of experience working now as a frontend developper in a digital agency. I currently live in Congo Brazzaville. I am pursuing my studies in order to get a degree in applied technologie. I know that there are many advantages in learning web design like the fact of working as a freelancer, being an online teacher or an employee in a big company. I choosed BYU-Idaho because I do like the way they teach by getting students help each other. I am still a bachelor who's looking for a good wife. I like the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, I regularly attend to church seminaries even if I am not a member of the church.

        <p>The Republic of Congo (Congo-Brazzaville), located in Central Africa, covers 342,000 km2. Its population of 5.7 million people is largely young, with 47% being under age 18. More than half of the population lives in its two main cities â€” Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire. The country is one of the least densely populated in Africa, with 14.8 inhabitants per square kilometer. 

        <br>Covered mainly by tropical forests, the Republic of Congo also has one of the largest areas of tropical peatlands, a fragile ecosystem that removes carbon from the atmosphere and stores it, thus helping to slow global warming..</p>
