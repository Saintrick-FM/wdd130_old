        I am a junior fullstack developper with 2 years of experience working now as a frontend developper in a digital agency. I currently live in Congo Brazzaville. I am pursuing my studies in order to get a degree in applied technologie. I know that there are many advantages in learning web design like the fact of working as a freelancer, being an online teacher or an employee in a big company. I choosed BYU-Idaho because I do like the way they teach by getting students help each other. I am still a bachelor who's looking for a good wife. I like the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, I regularly attend to church seminaries even if I am not a member of the church.
